    <h2>CHILDHOOD</h1>
    <p> In April of 2001, I was born in Hackensack, NJ. My parents and I lived with our
        in Montclair, NJ, until I was eight. My parents separated, and my Dad
        moved across town. Soon after, my mom and I also moved across town. My parents    
        maintained a good friendship, and I split my time between them.</p>
    <h2>SCHOOL</h2>   
    <p>I spent my K-8 years in the Montclair Public School System. I first attended the Nishuane School from kindergarten 
       to second grade, Hillside Elementary School from third to fifth grade, and Glenfield Middle School from sixth to 
       eight grade. Following eight grade, I chose to attend Seton Hall Preparatory School, a private school in West Orange, NJ.
       Adjusting to Catholic school involved a significant learning curve - I was not raised Catholic. However, once I got used
       to it and made friends, I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. I spent two years there, and transferred to Bergen Catholic
       High School in Oradell, NJ, going into my junior year. I graduated from Bergen Catholic and elected to attend 
       The College of New Jersey.</p>
    <h2>NOW</h2>   
    <p>I am currently in my second semester at TCNJ. I love TCNJ and will be back next year. Sadly, school right now is 
    school without the fun. The COVID-19 outbreak has put on hold my time on campus, but I'm sure this hiatus will make
    returning even sweeter. Right now, I am in Florida at my step dad's house with him, my mom, my step sister, and my dog.  
    This was our attempt to escape the COVID-19 hotspot that is the Northeast. I am working out a lot, slowly but surely 
    completing my school work, and spending time with my mom.
