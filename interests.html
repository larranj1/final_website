	<h2>SPORTS</h2>
	<p>I have always been super active. As a little kid, I couldn't sit still unless you held me still.
	   Sports became my best friend. Growing up, I didn't play many sports, but the ones I did play,
	   I played a lot. Basketball has been a part of my family for generations, so naturally, I gravitated
	   toward it. I definitely played basketball the most, and this trend continued. (I did
	   try skateboarding for a while, as pictured below!) Nowadays, I watch tons
	   of basketball, but I have mostly lost interest in watching other sports. I also love golfing, 
	   biking, and lifting.</p>
	   
	<h2>MUSIC</h2>
	<p>A basketball was the first thing put in my hands. However, the first thing I gravitated toward on 
	my own was drums. As young as two-years-old, I was crawling into the kitchen cabinets, pulling out pots and pans
	to bang on with wooden spoons. My inspiration was Phil Collins, whom I watched preform on a live DVD
	my dad played for me. My music taste is extremely broad. First, I took to my dad's tastes which prompted
	my interest in drums. I then ventured into metal, which, to this day, remains my favorite genre 
	(including <i>almost</i> all of the subgenres), and grew interested in guitar. In middle school, I was 
	introduced to hip-hop and rap, and took interest in producing. Today, I have a special
	relationship with music. I still play drums, guitar, and produce daily. Music was my first passion, and 
	it will remain a major part of me for the rest of my life.</p>
	
	<h2>CREATIVITY</h2>
	Creating music was one way I expressed my creativity growing up, but it was not my only creative 
	outlets. I made cardboard ramps for finger skateboards, duct tape wallets (which I made a lot of money
	doing), paper airplanes, paper models of many different things, massive lego structures, buildings out 
	of Kapla Blocks, and more. I think this was one of the reasons I enjoyed this course. I was
	able to apply the concepts we learned to make a website that I am proud of. I will admit, coding involves
	a little more sitting still than I'd like, but the final product was well worth it.
