	<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
	<p>My family has been in the basketball world for a long time. My uncle is the current head coach for the University of Miami. 
	In 2006, he led George Mason University to the NCAA D1 Final Four as the head coach. My cousin is currently the lead assistant coach
	for the Boston Celtics. He has been interviewed for a number of NBA head coaching jobs but has not made that step quite yet. 
	A few of my family members played professionally overseas, and I am the sixth (as far as I know) to play at the collegiate level.</p>
	
	<h2>EARLY</h2>
	<p>When I was younger, I played for the town team, club teams, and went to camps. I eventually grew sick of it because
	I wasn't that into it. I took some time off in middle school to focus on drumming and music, but 
	revived my interest in organized ball by eight grade.</p> 
	
	<h2>HIGH SCHOOL</h2>
	<p>I ended up attending Seton Hall Prep mostly for basketball - they 
	were known to have a good program. The program, which had seen a coaching change shortly before I arrived, was beginning to 
	slip from its status, so I (along with a handful of high level players) transferred after two years. I transferred to Bergen
	Catholic and played two years for a budding high school powerhouse. We lost (got jipped) in the state final my senior year 
	and ended ranked top 40 in the country. I was the sixth man on a team with nine total players with D1 scholarships. A year 
	removed from it, Bergen is now landing some of the highest ranked eight grade basketball prospects in the 
	country. I would trade my experience for nothing. However, it was not always fun. In fact, it was quite stressful. I felt
	overshadowed by some of my teammates, who went on to play at high major D1 schools. I knew I was better than the attention 
	I was getting (and so did my teammates), but I am thankful for how it all played out because I love where I ended up.</p>
	
	<h2>SUMMER</h2>
	<p>I spent my summers working out, playing club basketball, and going to basketball camps. I had fun, but it was super tiring, and I was 
	glad when it was over at the end of the summer. I got injured at the beginning of my last summer of basketball and missed two months.
	I hurt my back, so it took a while to return to form even after I was "healed". This stunted my recruiting, 
	and put me at the end of the bench for my club team. It was extremely frustrating, and I hated basketball by the end of it, but in 
	a weird way, I miss it.
	
	<h2>NOW</h2>
	<p>I committed to The College of New Jersey in late April of my senior year of High School. I contemplated 
	not playing in college because the last year and a half of basketball had not been what I had hoped they'd be. I even 
	considered quitting before my senior season. Obviously, I'm glad I didn't; I became an integral part of 
	our 2018-2019 championship team, and now, I love basketball more than ever. I truly fell in love with the game during
	my freshman season at TCNJ. I had a very successful first season, and I look forward to next year.
	I hope to extend my basketball career as long as possible. </p>
